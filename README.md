# SBOL Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)

SEP stands for SBOL Enhancement Proposal. A SEP is a design document providing information to the [Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)](http://sbolstandard.org) community. It may describe a new feature or term for the SBOL data model or a rule or organizational process that the SBOL community should follow. The SEP should provide the rationale and a concise technical specification of the feature.

SEPs are the primary mechanisms for proposing major data model changes, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into SBOL. The SEP authors are responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

SEPs are filed by SBOL editors in a dedicated issue tracker on github. If not withdrawn, an SEP will eventually be put to a vote by the SBOL community.

For a complete explanation of the SEP process, please refer to [SEP#1](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/issues/1)
