## Abstract

This proposal will add Interactions and Models onto ComponentDefinition, effectively merging ModuleDefinition into ComponentDefinition. This will allow ModuleDefinition and all of its relations to be deprecated.

## Motivation <a name='motivation'></a>

Currently, when describing composition of devices, one typically has to maintain a precisely parallel hierarchy of `ComponentDefinition` and `ModuleDefinition` objects. This is confusing and seems unnecessary, as when one composes two designs, both their structure and their function should compose.

Similarly, the boundary between structural and functional composition is often unclear, and can cause miscategorizations that are problematic to correct.  For example, we are using `ModuleDefinition` to represent mixtures (e.g., growth media) while `ComponentDefinition` is used to represent covalently bonded structures (e.g., DNA, pure chemicals).  If you aren't sure if a reagent is a 

In short, there doesn't seem to be any value to separating structure and function, so we are going to let one object contain both types of information.

## Specification <a name='specification'></a>

### Adjustments to ComponentDefinition

The `ComponentDefinition` class will be enhanced by addition of the `models` and `interactions` properties, exactly equivalent to how they are currently used in `ModuleDefinition`.

Additional validation rules to add are:

- A weak REQUIRED condition for `ComponentDefinition`: there must only be a `sequence` or `sequenceAnnotation` if all `components` can be linearized onto a single sequence. 
- A weak REQUIRED condition for `SequenceConstraint` is that the `subject` and `object` must both be components with a sequence.

Implications of this elaboration:

- Physically linking sequences in two devices together is simpler (e.g., the promoter output of a device to the CDS input of another). Instead of being specified with a separate `ComponentDefinition`, the two can be directly linked via a `SequenceConstraint`.
- A combinatorial derivation can now express combinatorial experimental conditions as well, via `VariableComponent` objects containing different amounts of ingredients in a sample (e.g., different inducers, different co-transfections)

### Adjustments to Component and Participation

The `direction` field from `FunctionalComponent` is moved up to `ComponentInstance`, such that it applies to `Component` as well.

For `Participation` objects, the `participant` property is generalized to allow `ComponentInstance` objects, not just `FunctionalComponent`.

### Deprecation of ModuleDefinition

The child classes used only by `ModuleDefinition` will also be removed. Those are `FunctionalComponent` and `Module`.

At that time, `FunctionalComponent` will also be removed, removing the need for subclassing `Component`.

## Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

Adding new fields to `ComponentDefinition` will not prevent continued use of existing `ModuleDefinitions`. Any existing `ModuleDefinition` can also be converted directly into an equivalent `ComponentDefinition` by 

In SBOL 3, `ModuleDefinition`, `FunctionalComponent`, and `Module` will all be deleted, which will obviously not be backward compatible.
